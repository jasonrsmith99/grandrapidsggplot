```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

grand_rapids <- read_csv(here::here("data", "grand_rapids.csv"))
```

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=15}
grand_rapids %>% 
ggplot()+
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = id, fill = neighborhood), color = "white")+
  theme_void()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
